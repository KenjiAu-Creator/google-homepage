From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

The first project of The Odin Project is to recreate the google homepage using HTML and CSS text files. This project is intended to wrap together all the introduction sections on HTML and CSS. Javascript will be covered later on.

Things I learned in this project:
1. Utilizing class and ID selectors for attributes. You can select specific items in HTML for CSS properties. 
2. Floats will override the flow of the document. The "children" aren't technically occupying space and thus the parent element collapses upon itself. You can use the overflow: hidden; to the parent element to override this.
